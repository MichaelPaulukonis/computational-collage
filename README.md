# Computational Collage

I've worked with other "collage" projects, but nothing made me very happy.

Then I looked again at , and liked a number of the results, despite them being utterly unlike anything I had worked with before.

Also taking inspiration from a Generatie Design application Code-Package-p5.js/01_P/P_4_2_1_02

## roadmap

- more like my stuff
  - hah! what does THAT mean ?!?!?
- play with blending modes
- bigger image fragments overlayed
- ~~"mondrian" mode takes from semi-random part of (original) image~~
- ~~Patterns in some of the blocks~~
- outline variety?
- animation of blocks coming and going
- in gallery, pick which ones are used for collage, which ones are used for background, etc. like picking (one or more )for colors
- there some UI in another tool I played with, about screens?
- phase out original buttons
- add help screen
- ~~publish to github.io~~
- outlines/masks into CollageImage class?
- import vector-path along with transparents for outlines

A Web-based Generative Collage Tool That Breathes New Life Into One’s Photo Collections


This project uses p5.js to explore ways to breathe new life into one’s digital photo collections through creative generative collaging. Collaging, the art of arranging different fragments in a frame, has long been a powerful device for expressions. Artists make collages to deliver manifestos through overlaying discrete fragments by hand or in photoshop. Social media users make collages to attract likes using photo editing apps. Either way, collaging is typically characterized by combinations of discrete objects or image frames.
