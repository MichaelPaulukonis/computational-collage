## roadmap

- fragment editor
  - POC https://editor.p5js.org/MichaelPaulukonis/sketches/kOTN9Q175
- phase out original buttons
- add help screen
- play with blending modes
- in gallery, pick which ones are used for collage, which ones are used for background, etc. like picking (one or more )for colors

A Web-based Generative Collage Tool That Breathes New Life Into One’s Photo Collections


This project uses p5.js to explore ways to breathe new life into one’s digital photo collections through creative generative collaging. Collaging, the art of arranging different fragments in a frame, has long been a powerful device for expressions. Artists make collages to deliver manifestos through overlaying discrete fragments by hand or in photoshop. Social media users make collages to attract likes using photo editing apps. Either way, collaging is typically characterized by combinations of discrete objects or image frames.
